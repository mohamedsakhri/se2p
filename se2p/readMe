HAL with two classes PortA and PortB.

Both classes are thread-safe :

set_Bit_on(uint_8) : to set a bit on, thread-sef using Port_Mutex
set_Bit_off(uint_8) : to set a bit off, thread-sef using Port_Mutex

 All other methods in PortA and PortC call these two methodes to set a bit on or off.
 
 Macros in main thread :
 - to run selected tests
 - to turn on/off mutex debuging

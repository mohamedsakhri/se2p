HAL has to be started from the Controler class by calling the getInstance methode.

Now, that we haven't dectared a controller class yet, it will be started in myThread

TO DO:
solving : undefined Reference for HALAktorik::getInstance(); 

Some tests : For each component a class to test it. It'd make more sense if they run as Threads

Tests will be added in a Test folder

Serial interface in a new Folder, called SerInterface
